Before this application can be used, the user must fill out a valid postgres username and password.

The above command will start the application in the terminal once a valid username and password have been saved in the index.js file. Once the application starts the user can then select from any of the options using the directional keys and submit their choice with the enter key. Depending on what the user is trying to do, they will be prompted with various fields to fill in order to accomplish their objective.
